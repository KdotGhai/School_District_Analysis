**1.District Summary:**
  -<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here we can notice there isnt much of a drastic change in District analsyis when exempting students, there isnt a large enough disparity in the total student count as well as, scores of students under the assumption there wasnt more dishonesty in student scores. <br />

**2.School Summary:**
   -<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we break down the data per school we canb egin to notice the devil in the details, *Thomas High School* performance is barely passing when including data of its 9th Graders. Afterward, once we'd exempted the entirety of their 9th grade students we see that the school performs better(the drastic difference in Overall Percentage Passing shows the impact of excluding data), ofcourse this data makes it biased if we had not included the orignal for comparison. <br />
